    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) consists of peanut butter and fruit preserves—jelly—spread on bread. The sandwich may be open-faced, made of a single slice of bread folded over, or made between two slices of bread. The sandwich is popular in the United States, especially among children; a 2002 survey showed the average American will eat 1,500 before graduating from high school.[1] There are many variations on the sandwich, starting with the basic peanut butter sandwich or jam sandwich.
