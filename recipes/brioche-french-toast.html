    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Brioche and challah bread make the best French toast. Both are already so eggy that once dipped in the batter and griddled in butter they become custard-like on the inside. The nicely browned and caramelized outside is thanks in part to the added sugar in the egg mixture. And playing with the flavor is easy: This recipe has a touch of warmth from cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Here's a pro tip: Make sure you don't over-soak the bread. Fully submerge it in the batter for only a few seconds and let any excess drip off before cooking. And wait for the bubbles from the melted butter to subside â€” that's when you know your pan is hot enough.
